# sieve-of-eratosthenes
Project displays a custom Gridview with some added animation effects (using sieve of Eratosthenes approach).

Also shows how to utilize YouTube Android API to stream YouTube videos.


I have added relevant comments in the code to help explain the flow. Please feel free to provide any feedback.
